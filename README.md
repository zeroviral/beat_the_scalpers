## Using the script

One thing to note here is to first create the file ``config.ini`` within the
 same directory as where you're putting your script.
 
 The ``config.ini`` file should be simply replaced with your personal details
  for the entry of delivery.
  
  
 * Make sure you're monitoring the script, as sometimes you'll need to
  manually bypass a captcha.
  
  * Also, make sure you're there to click through anything that may not be
   present in the script (such as confirming this is your correct address
   , the script doesn't account for this as it's not common)
   
  * I've left the config.ini file here so you may simply copy and paste it
  . For those without an IDE, you'll need to use VIM to edit the file, or a
   text editor that can open it as a ``.txt`` file for editing.
